## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I do not have very much experience programming with Swift so everything that I did with this app is all new stuff for me. I had to learn all of this before I wrote the app but it was not too difficult. I am happy with how the app turned out and I look forward to learning more about Swift and how to make applications that look great and run smoothly.
